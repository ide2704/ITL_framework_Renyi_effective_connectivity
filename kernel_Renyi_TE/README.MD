# Kernel-based_Transfer_Entropy

Phython implementation of the approach proposed in the paper "A data-driven measure of 
effective connectivity based on Renyiâ€™s alpha-entropy". 

The script Main_kTE.py reproduces the results for the kernel-based Renyi transfer entropy method (alpha = 2) shown in Figure 2A of the paper. 
The methodology itself is implemented in the script TransferEntropy.py.
