# Directed_PAC_through_kernel-based_Phase_Transfer_Entropy

Phython implementation of the approach proposed in the paper "Estimating directed phase-amplitude
interactions from EEG data through kernel-based phase transfer entropy". 

The script Main_directed_PAC_phase_kTE.py reproduces the results shown in Figure 4 of the paper. 
The methodology itself is implemented in the script TransferEntropy.py.
